Recommendation for CISM Exam:<BR />

Read the answers to the questions FIRST<BR />
Once you've read all of the answers, read the question SECOND.<BR />
Once you've read the answers and the question, eliminate ANY answers that potentially compromise LIFE.<BR />
If LIFE is not a factor, eliminate ANY answers that compromise ETHICS.<BR />
If LIFE and ETHICS are not a factor look for key indicator words like ALWAYS and/or EVERYONE.<BR />
If LIFE, ETHICS, key indicators ALWAYS and/or EVERYONE are not a factor than select the answer that is BEST FOR THE ORGANIZATION.<BR />

Factors for question answers:<BR />
LIFE, ETHICS, ALWAYS/EVERYONE, Organization<BR />
